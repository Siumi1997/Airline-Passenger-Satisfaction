Customers' expectations from an airline are increasing as new technologies are introduced. The customers not only expect safe transportation but also expects more benefits and facilities through their journey. Therefore, the airline industry is working more on satisfying the customers by giving the facilities and comfort which customer expects. The main objective of this analysis is to build a statistical learning model to predict the customer satisfaction of airlinesâ€™ passengers. Also, the analysis was extended to find out the main factor that affects customer satisfaction.

Descriptive analysis proved that the satisfaction levels of in-flight food and drink, onboard service, and seat comfort play a massive part in overall customer satisfaction. Also, it has been pointed out that passenger satisfaction is highly dependent on customer class too. Advanced analysis was carried out by fitting the models using Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest, XGBoosting, Logistic Regression with Ridge, Lasso, and Elastic Net Penalty Techniques. The models were evaluated and compared using AUC Values and Model Accuracy Values. The model fitted using XGBoosting techniques gave the highest AUC Value and Model Accuracy which are 0.95 and 95.54% respectively. Also, it has been found that online boarding, type of travel, in-flight wi-fi service, in-flight entertainment, on-board service, baggage handling, in-flight service, seat comfort, customer type, and check-in service are the most important features of the model with the highest accuracy.
